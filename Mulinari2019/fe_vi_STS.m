% fe_vi_STS - V-I trajectory features in steady and transient states:
% This function extract the features of V-I trajectory according with 
% the article "A New Set of Steady-State and Transient Features for 
% Power Signature Analysis Based on V-I Trajectory".
%
% IN:
% Vs - vector with one voltage cycle in steady state
% Is - vector with one current cycle in steady state
% Vt - vector with one voltage cycle in transient state
% It - vector with one current cycle in transient state
% nload -  number of load (to plot)
%
% OUT:
% vetor_features -  vector with 12 features proposed in the article.
