# The project

 * 1 - What is this project?
     
     This project was created to extract features from the V-I trajectory for the classification step in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) approaches. V-I trajectory creates two-dimensional shapes from the plot of one cycle of the voltage by one cycle of the system's measured current.
    
 * 2 - Which software was used to develop and use this project?
     
     Matlab R2017b and R2019b

# Files
*	current_features_2018: In this folder, we included the codes of V-I based features presented in the literature until 2018.
*	Mulinari2019: The codes in this folder are explained and detailed in the paper “A New Set of Steady-State and Transient Features for Power Signature Analysis Based on V-I Trajectory". IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technology Latin America, 2019.
*	F2D: The codes in this folder are explained and detailed in the paper “Feature Extraction of V-I Trajectory using 2-D Fourier Series for Electrical Load Classification". Submitted to IEEE Sensors Journal, 2021 (under review).
*	The details of each feature are presented in the corresponding M-files
